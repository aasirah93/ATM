Bank Tech Test
A practice test delivered at Makers Academy, focused on the production of best practice code, obeying the principles of OO Design and TDD.

Requirements:
Build a command line app that operates like a bank account - a user should be able to make deposits and withdrawals and request an account statement detailing the date, amount, and balance of all transactions.

Approach
To better understand the requirements of the brief, I broke down the requested features into User Stories.

User Stories
As a user,
So that I can save my money,
I'd like to be able to deposit funds in my bank account.

As a user,
So that I can access my savings,
I'd like to be able to withdraw funds from my bank account.

As a user,
So that I can review the timing of my transactions,
I'd like to be able to view the date each transaction was made.

As a user,
So that I can check what savings I have available,
I'd like to be able to view my statement.
